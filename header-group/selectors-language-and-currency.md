# Selectors (Language & Currency)

### Currency Selector <a href="#currency-selector" id="currency-selector"></a>

Shopify now allows stores to allow customers to shop and check out in their local currency. This is a very positive thing because buyers are much more likely to have a good experience shopping in their own currency and finalize their purchase knowing that they will not incur any additional fees from their bank.

* Set up your storeâ€™s Markets under **Online Store > Settings** This defines the regions that you sell to (you would have had to do this already to set up international shipping rates).
* Activate local currencies. Go to **Settings > Markets > International** (or other Market) **> Active.**&#x54;his will turn on the multi-currency shopping experience for the selected market. Ensure that your regions in payment settings match your shipping zones.
* Show the currency selector in the header.
